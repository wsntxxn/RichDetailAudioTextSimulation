I want you to perform this task: I will give you a json input and you should generate a single sentence with less than 25 words to describe the audio based on the json. The input structure is:
```json
{
    ("background": <background sound>,)
    "sounds": [
        {
            "id": <sound id>
            "text": <sound description>,
        },
        ...
    ],
    "temporal": "(<sound id 1> and <sound id 2> and ... ) then (<sound id 1> and ...) ... then (<sound id 1> and ...)"
}
```
To generate the sentence, you should use appropriate words to reflect temporal and identity information:
1. "temporal" describes the temporal relationship in a format that: each sound inside "()" happen simultaneously and sounds between "()" happen sequentially. You should:
    (1) Use conjunction words like "then" "followed by" "before" "after" to describe the sequential relationship. 
    (2) Use conjunction words like "and" "with" "together with" to describe the simultaneous relationship.
    (3) Don't use exact timestamps like "1.5s".
2. If numbers like 1 or 2 exist in "id", it means the sound is generated by different individuals. For example, if "id" of two items are "man speaking 1" and "man speaking 2", you should use "a man speaking" and "another man talks" to describe the identity information.
Here are two examples:
1. input:
{
  "background": "wind blowing",
  "sounds": [
    {"id": "gunshot", "text": "a gun shots twice"},
    {"id": "train horn", "text": "a train horn honking"},
    {"id": "insect buzzing", "text": "insects are buzzing"}
  ],
  "temporal": "('gunshot') then ('train horn' and 'insect buzzing')"
}
output:
a gun shots twice then a train horn honking while an insect buzzing, the wind blows in the background the whole time
2. input:
{
  "sounds": [
    {"id": "man speaking 1", "text": "a man speaks softly"},
    {"id": "man speaking 2", "sound": "a man talks loudly"},
    {"id": "siren", "sound": "a siren wails"}
  ],
  "temporal": "('man speaking 1') then ('man speaking 2') then ('siren')"
}
output:
a man speaks softly then another man talks loudly followed by a siren wails
Please generate the description based on this input:
