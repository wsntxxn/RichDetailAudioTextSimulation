I want you to perform this task: generate the text description of an audio given the input json. The input structure is:
{
    "sounds": [
        {
            "sound": <sound type>,
            ("times": <occuring times>,)
            ("loudness": <loudness>,)
            ("id": <sound id>)
        },
        ...
    ],
    ("temporal": "(<sound id 1> and <sound id 2> and ... ) then (<sound id 1> and ...) ... then (<sound id 1> and ...)")
}
"times", "loudness", "id" and "temporal" are not necessarily included.
To generate a description sentence based on this structured data, you should:
1. Describe the background and all sounds in "sounds".
2. For each sound, if "loudness" exists, describe its loudness using specific words according to the sound type, e.g., (speak) loudly, low (vibrating noise), softly, a strong (wind), etc.
3. If "times" exists, it means this sound is times-sensitive, you should use corresponding words to describe:
    (1) If the value > 3, using vague words like "multiple times", "many times", etc.
    (2) Otherwise, using exact words like "twice", "three times", etc.
4. If "id" exists for a sound or "sound" ends with a number, it means this sound is identity-sensitive, use corresponding words to describe it:
    (1) If "id" is "single", it means a single object sounds <times> times. For example, "times" is 3 and "sound" is gunshot, you can say "a gun shots three times"
    (2) If "id" is "multiple", it means different object sounds <times> times. For example, "times" is 2 and "sound" is "dog barking", you can say "two dogs bark"
    (3) If "sound" ends with a number n, it means the n-th object of this sound type. For example, two "sound" values are "man speaking 1" and "man talking 2", you can say "a man speaks" and "another man talks"
5. Connect sound descriptions into a single sentence with less than 25 words. If "temporal" exists, use conjunction words according to the relationship. Each sound inside "()" happen simultaneously and sounds between "()" happen sequentially.
    (1) Use words like "then" "followed by" "before" "after" to describe the sequential relationship
    (2) Use words like "and" "with" "together with" to describe the simultaneous relationship
    (3) If "temporal" does not exist, just use "and" "with". Don't use sequential words!
Here are a few examples:
1. input:
{
    "sounds": [
        {"sound": "wind blowing"},
        {"sound": "gunshot", "times": 2, "id": "single"},
        {"sound": "door closing"}
    ],
    "temporal": "('gunshot') then ('door closing')"
}
output:
a gun shots twice then a door is closed with wind blowing
2. input:
{
    "sounds": [
        {"sound": "man speaking 1", "loudness": "loud"},
        {"sound": "man speaking 2", "loudness": "loud"},
    ],
    "temporal": "('man speaking 1') then ('man speaking 2')"
}
output:
a man speaks loudly followed by another man speaking loudly
3. input:
{
    "sounds": [
        {"sound": "woman speaking"},
        {"sound": "bird chirping"},
    ]
}
output:
a woman speaks and birds chirp
4. input:
{
    "sounds": [
        {"sound": "dog barking", "loudness": "low"}
    ]
}
output: a faint dog barking sound
Please generate the description based on the following input, don't describe temporal relationships that are not provided!
