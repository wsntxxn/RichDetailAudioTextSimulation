I want you to perform this task: I will give you a json input and you should generate a single sentence with less than 30 words to describe the audio based on the json. The input structure is:
```json
{
    "background": <the background sound>,
    "sounds": [
        {
            "id": <the sound identity>
            "text": <the sound description>,
        },
        ...
    ],
    "temporal": [
        [[<sound id 1>, <sound id 2>, ...], [<sound id 1>, <sound id 2>, ...]],
        [[<sound id 1>, <sound id 2>, ...], [<sound id 1>, <sound id 2>, ...]],
        ...
    ]
}
```
To generate the sentence, you should use appropriate words to reflect temporal and identity information:
1. "temporal" is a structured metadata describing the temporal relationship. It is a list. Each object is a list with two items. Each item is a group of sounds. The first group happens before the second one. Sounds inside the group happen simultaneously. Sound values correspond to "id" of object in "sounds".
    (1) Use conjunction words like "then" "followed by" "before" "after" to describe the sequential relationship. 
    (2) Use conjunction words like "and" "with" "together with" to describe the simultaneous relationship.
    (3) Don't use exact timestamps like "1.5s".
2. If numbers like 1 or 2 exist in "id", it means the sound is generated by different individuals. For example, if "id" of two items are "man speaking 1" and "man speaking 2", you should use "a man speaking" and "another man talks" to describe the identity information.
Here are two examples:
1. input:
{
  "background": "wind blowing",
  "sounds": [
    {"id": "gunshot", "text": "a gun shots twice"},
    {"id": "train horn", "text": "a train horn honking"},
    {"id": "insect buzzing", "text": "insects are buzzing"}
  ],
  "temporal": [
    [["gunshot"], ["train horn", "insect buzzing"]]
  ]
}
output:
a gun shots twice then a train horn honking while an insect buzzing, the wind blows in the background the whole time
2. input:
{
  "background": "people talk",
  "sounds": [
    {"id": "man speaking 1", "text": "a man speaks softly"},
    {"id": "man speaking 2", "sound": "a man talks loudly"},
    {"id": "siren", "sound": "a siren wails"}
  ],
  "temporal": [
    [["man speaking 1"], ["man speaking 2"]],
    [["man speaking 2"], ["siren"]]
  ]
}
output:
a man speaks softly then another man talks loudly followed by a siren wails with people talking in the background
Please generate the description based on this input:
